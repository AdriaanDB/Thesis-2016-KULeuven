Here are cases to go further with the project. </br>

- darcyPorous </br>
Uses porousSimpleFoam to simulate the porous zone. </br>
Mesh is a hexagonal mesh with porous zone defined as a cellZone. </br>

- porousDamBreak </br>
Uses interFoam to simulate a zone of water collapsing against the porous structure.
