This is the README file of the OpenFOAM run directory with relevant case examples. </br>

Because of upload limitations the mesh is not in the case files. <br>
But such files can be found with following link: [](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rwy53o0apgr1hb5/AAA2CulbtENjS414E5QVfFnKa?dl=0) </br>

Folder contains:</br>
- 2D case
- Laminar example
- kEpsilon example
- kOmega example

To construct cases one can chose the initial velocity and import the mesh.
