This is the README file of Export folder. </br>

The Export folder contains: </br>
- exported .brep files that hold different geometries. </br>
Files are too big, but can be found here: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rwy53o0apgr1hb5/AAA2CulbtENjS414E5QVfFnKa?dl=0)
- script to automate fusing of different geometry parts (makeWhole.py) </br>
- script to automate meshing and grouping (makeGroups.py) </br>

Step 1: Get a text file spheres*amount* that was randomized and filtered </br>
Step 2: Build the porous unit with salome script build.py </br>
Step 3: Make the whole geometry with makeWhole.py (fusing parts) </br>
Step 4: Make the mesh manually or with makeGroup.py
